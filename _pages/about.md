I am completing my **Master's of Science in Mechanical Engineering (Thesis)** at McGill University under the supervision of [Professor James Richard Forbes](https://www.mcgill.ca/mecheng/james-forbes) at [DECAR](https://www.decar.ca/). My research focuses on interpreting optimization algorithms as control systems.

I obtained my **Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering** from McGill University. My capstone project was completed in colaboration with the [Interstellar Flight Experimental Research Group](https://interstellarflight.space/) under the supervision of [Professor Andrew J. Higgins](https://www.mcgill.ca/mecheng/people/faculty/staff/andrewhiggins). Moreover, I completed two summer research internships in the [Mydlarski Laboratory](https://mydlarski.lab.mcgill.ca/) under the supervision of [Professor Laurent Mydlarski](https://www.mcgill.ca/mecheng/laurent-mydlarski).
